# Copilot Instructions for TestingDemo-02

This repository is a knowledge demonstration of software testing concepts and modern technologies.

## Repository Purpose

This project showcases various software testing methodologies, patterns, and best practices. When working on this repository, prioritize code quality, test coverage, and clear documentation.

## Coding Standards

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly express intent
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single responsibility
- Comment complex logic and non-obvious implementation decisions

## Testing Best Practices

- **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage across all code changes
- **Test Types**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as appropriate
- **Test Quality**: Write tests that are:
  - Clear and easy to understand
  - Independent and isolated
  - Fast and reliable
  - Focused on behavior rather than implementation
- **Test Organization**: Structure tests to mirror the code organization
- **Test Documentation**: Include descriptive test names and comments explaining the purpose of complex test scenarios

## Documentation Requirements

- Update README.md when adding new features or making significant changes
- Document public APIs, classes, and functions
- Include usage examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Add comments for complex algorithms or business logic

## Code Review Guidelines

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting code
- Verify that new code follows the established patterns in the repository
- Check for proper error handling and edge cases
- Review security implications of code changes
- Validate that documentation is updated as needed

## Technology Stack

When adding new dependencies or technologies:
- Ensure they align with the repository's educational purpose
- Provide clear documentation on setup and usage
- Include tests demonstrating the technology's usage
- Consider the learning value for software testing concepts

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Reference related issues or tickets when applicable
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed explanations in the commit body when necessary
